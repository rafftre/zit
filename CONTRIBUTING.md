# Contributing to Zit

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
This document outlines contribution guidelines.
Please take a moment to review it before getting started.

## Project Status

This project is currently in its initial, exploratory phase.
The main goals right now are to establish the basic architecture,
define the main features, and explore the best path forward.

To maintain a focused and consistent development process during this phase,
direct contributions to the code are limited to a pre-approved team.
The plan is to open contributions to the wider community as the project matures.

## How You Can Help

Although contributions to the code are limited,
you can help in the following ways:
- Reporting Bugs: if you find something that doesn't work.
- Suggesting Enhancements: if you have ideas for new features or improvements.
- Providing Feedback: for general feedback on the direction and goals of the project.
All submissions will be reviewed by authorized contributors,
though no guarantees can be made regarding response or implementation times.

## Repository and Issue Tracker

Project development and issue tracking happens at
[codeberg.org/rafftre/zit](https://codeberg.org/rafftre/zit).

The repository on GitHub is a publish-only mirror and is not actively monitored for community interaction.

All issues, bug reports, and suggestions MUST be submitted via the
[Codeberg issue tracker](https://codeberg.org/rafftre/zit/issues).

Submissions through other channels, including GitHub pull requests, will be ignored.

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report,
please search the Codeberg issue tracker to see if it has already been reported.
If not, create a new issue detailing:
1. A clear, descriptive title.
2. The software version you are using.
3. Steps to reproduce the bug.
4. The expected vs. actual outcome.
5. Any relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages.
